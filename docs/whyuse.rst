Why I should use it ?
-----------------------
Tired of spending hours in PVWA to click on non responsive buttons or switching to "classic UI" to perform boring tasks that became impossible with the new interface ?

Tired of debugging your PASReporter configuration to finally reconfigure filters to try to find the information your responsible ask you for hours ?

Or perhaps you run very long powershell scripts with a paper "DO NOT STOP THIS MACHINE" taped of the screen ?

And in addition you want to automatize everything and you are lost in thousand of lines of incomprehensible, undocumented and untested code ?

You should consider this !

With a powerful interface to Cyberark's API, fully asynchronous and designed by Cyberark experts you can quickly operate massive changes on your accounts in a very simple and quick way.
