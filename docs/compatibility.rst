Component compatibility
===============================

PVWA
-------
Versions known to be compatible today are 12.2.x and 12.6.x.

If you have an older version, some functions won't work and you'll raise a CyberarkException "Your PVWA version does not support this function".

This version was initially developed for version 12.1, then updated for version 12.2.
We've made every effort to keep the package backward-compatible with version 12.1, but for technical reasons we can only test on one version at a time and can't guarantee this 100%.
If you find any inconsistencies, please don't hesitate to create an issue.

All new versions of this package will be tested on version 12.6.x.

AIM
------
All versions of AIM that we were able to test (v12+) were compatible with this package.
